# ML Engineer Practical Assessment

This repository contains the complete solution for the ML Engineer Practical Assessment.

## Task 1: Production-Grade ML Pipeline
- Performed data validation and cleaning
- Implemented feature engineering with 4 meaningful features
- Built Logistic Regression baseline model
- Used Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Ensured reproducibility with fixed random seeds
- Saved and loaded model using joblib

## Task 2: Model Debugging & Stability
- Identified root causes of instability (randomness, preprocessing inconsistency, class imbalance)
- Implemented deterministic cross-validation
- Ensured consistent inference pipeline using saved scaler and model
- Demonstrated stable predictions

## Task 3: Model Performance Improvement
- Improved baseline model using Random Forest ensemble
- Achieved more than 10% improvement in F1-score
- Justified improvement due to non-linear pattern learning

## Task 4: ML System Design (Fraud Detection)
- Designed end-to-end production ML system
- Included data ingestion, training, inference, monitoring, and retraining
- Provided architecture diagram and trade-offs
